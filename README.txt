Genecount normalizer. 
Version 4.1
Made by Mátyás Schiller

Usage:
The genecount normalizer uses --input and --monogram options. The --intput designates the input file.
However it can take direct input, if wanted to be used in a pipeline. The --monogram option designates
the user's monogram, thus helping the files to be identified. The default monogram is "00". The requirements
can be found in the requirements.txt.
